wordgolem README
================

A script for generating random gibberish from a minecraft server.log
or the KJV Bible.

Requirements
------------

You need these to run this program:

* coreutils
* bash
* dadadodo

You will need a version of coreutils that contains `shuf`. If your system
doesn't have `shuf`, you can grab the `random` script from my buceutils project
and replace occurences of `shuf -e -n 1` with `random echo`.

For KJV functionality, you will need:

* curl
* dos2unix
* unzip

wordgolem can also send the generated sentences to screen or tmux if you have
one of them installed.

Overview
--------
Install wordgolem in your +PATH+, modify the variables near the top so that
they're sane, and set it executable.

To generate the data that wordgolem relies on:

	wordgolem init # generate data from chat messages in server.log

	wordgolem kjv  # generate data from KJV Bible

If you execute both commands, wordgolem will randomly select which data to use
each time it is run.

To generate gibberish based on the data sources you set up:

	wordgolem        # print data source to stderr and nonsense to stdout

	wordgolem screen # send nonsense to screen

	wordgolem tmux   # send nonsense to tmux
